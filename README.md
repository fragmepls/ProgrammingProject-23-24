<br>
<b>Main area:</b> export<br>
<br>
<b>Interface to other components:</b><br>
<li><b>The 'Export' Interface:</b><br>
The 'Export' Interface is the most important Interface of the export package as it allows to export either a 'FixedShiftSchedule' as a CSV file or the list of some Employees as a JSON file.<br>
As the FixedShiftSchedule and all its supporter Classes are also in the export package, they could be seen as equally important. The public methods and classes have all JavaDoc descriptions.<br>
<br>
<b>Third-Party libraries used:</b><br>
<li>Jackson by fasterXML<br>
<br>
<b>Programming techniques used:</b><br>
I've used different techniques leanrned in the lectures wherever useful and if they were presented bevore I had finished the part of the project where a certain technique may have been useful.<br>
I have used different aspects of techniques presented in the lectures about I/O and JSON Serialization.<br>
I have tried to implement the best suiting data structured known to me at the time of programming.<br>
Furthermore I tried to cath all exceptions and tried to design the methods so they are easier to debug.<br>
<br>
<b>Human experience out of my perception</b><br>
<br>
<b>Workload:</b><br>
I believe we have been able to split the workload quite equally. We made a list of all the to-do's and the members of the group decided according to their ability and interest on which one thy wanted to work.<br>
<br>
<b>Use of git:</b><br>
We used git as a version control system. Everyone of us had his own branch and whenever a part was finished he merged with the main channel and pushed the changes.<br>
<br>
<b>Challenge(s):</b><br>
<i>Programing challenges:</i><br>
I didn't face an major challenges while programming. It took me a few tries to export a 'nice looking' CSV of the schedule and I struggeled a bit on how to structure my part of the project properly.<br>
I had also some difficulties designing the FixedShiftSchedule data structure due to not knowing how to generically program at the time.<br>
Obviously there were some minor challenges that needed some resarch but nothing overwhelming.<br>
<br>
<i>Human challenges:</i><br>
There were some difficulties structuring the project and the workload poperly and organising/coordinating the project<br>
But nothing unexpected for being the first group project in university. I definitely have taken some learnings I wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
